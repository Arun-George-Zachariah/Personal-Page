A Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Missouri-Columbia, under the guidance of [Dr. Praveen Rao](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/home). I am a part of the [Scalable Data Science (SDS) Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/raopraveen/sds-lab) at the School of Engineering, where I develop and hack scalable algorithms and systems for data and knowledge management, and information retrieval. I am also affiliated with the [Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI)](https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/center-for-biomedical-informatics), at the School of Medicine, where I test innovative applications of AI in the various fields of medicine. My main research interests are in the areas of data & knowledge management, data science and applied machine learning. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Technology Analyst at [Infosys Technologies](https://www.infosys.com), a global leader in software development, consulting for [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com).

Apart from being a true petrolhead, I share a passion with my father for following developments in the heavy-duty vehicle industry. All derived from our common passion for taming butch vehicles. While his interests are on the mechanical side, I look at the electronics of it. So, If I am not in front of the terminal, youâ€™ll find me in a nearby garage enjoying those modern machineries.
