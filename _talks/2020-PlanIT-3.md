As per the 2030 challenge, all new buildings, developments, and major renovations shall beÂ carbon-neutral by 2030. In this talk, as a step forward towards achieving sustainable design of buildings we present our objective of developing a unified and accurate deep learning-based model for predicting energy usage of different building types. In addition to it, we also present our evaluation results compared against traditional machine learning techniques.
