The global image recognition market is expected to reach $40 billion by 2021. There is a growing demand for intelligent image retrieval solutions for specialized domains. With this in mind, we design QIK, a system for large-scale image retrieval. As an update to the Spring 2019 Semiannual meeting, in this presentation, we describe the outcomes in terms of the system evaluation and a few search results from QIK.
